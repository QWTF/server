*============================================================================*

Changelog:

--------------------------------------------
Version 2.93.3					  06/20/2014
--------------------------------------------

Changes:
	- The following serverinfo values now accept both "on" and "1" for convenience: (Up2)
		bd/birthday
		lg/locked_game
		a/autoteam
		t/teamfrags
		fts/fullteamscore
		og/old_grenades/old_grens
		ncd/newcountdown
		ec/exec_class
		em/exec_map
		exec_map_cfgs
		flag_emu
		ws/use_standard
	- Serverinfo shorthand for instant grenades is now "ig", for "newcountdown" is "ncd" (Up2)
	- Displaying the number of detpacks the demoman has remaining in the sbar has been removed (too much space) (Up2)
	- Status bar now displays grenades 1/2 as "G: x/y" instead of "G1: x G2: y" so it's more legible (Up2)

Bugs Fixed:
	- Bugfix from tf2.9: Correctly display the winning team with less negative frags than other teams with more negative frags
		(and 0 caps on either team) (Up2)
	- Changeclass now works in Public mode (hifi)
	- Time remaining reminders now work in all game modes (match/public servers) (Up2)
	- Removed decimal places from sentrygun ammo/health (hifi)
	- Fix endless intermission if there is no next map (hifi)
	- Don't allow spawning during intermission (hifi)
	
Known Bugs:
	- Changeclass does not currently work during prematch
	- Ceasefire may not work correctly since /ready system has been introduced
	- /rpickup after the first time isn't very random
	- Some players may have to /ready multiple times before it registers

--------------------------------------------
Version 2.93.2					  02/14/2014
--------------------------------------------

Features Added:
	- No more prematch timer (yay!). Now, all players must type /ready for the match to begin. The
	  serverinfo pm field is ignored. However, serverinfo c/clan must be "on" (Up2)
	- Typing /list will print a list of people who are not yet /ready. Works once every 10 seconds. (Up2/gnounc/Basic)
	- New serverinfo status fields set by the game: (Up2)
		"Public" when serverinfo "c" or "clan" is off
		"Prematch" when serverinfo "c" or "clan" is on but match hasn't started
		"Countdown" when countdown is in progress
		"x min left" when a clan game is in progress - This syncs ezQuake gameclock if players/specs come mid-game.
		"Standby" after a match is over and scores are being displayed (before map resets)
	- New serverinfo status2 "Match" set when a clan game is in progress for easier parsing (Up2)
	- Reminders every minute, at 30 seconds, and 10 seconds of time remaining. (Up2)
	- Added "id" command to spectators for two reasons: 1) If you have bind x "+attack;id" bound and change
	  from player to spectator, you would get unknown alias "id" spam. 2) Doesn't hurt. (Up2)
	- New countdown menu (similar to KTX) has been fixed. It will automatically detect if you have sbar on,
	  and if so, turn it off during countdown and then turn it back on when countdown is over. No more flickering.
	  Must use "serverinfo newcountdown on" at the moment to use it. (Up2/KillJoy)
	- Grenades can now be thrown while firing a weapon. Must have serverinfo instantgrenades 1 (Basic)

Changes:
	- Status bar updated. For spies it will display "Not undercover" when not disguised. Lots of bugs fixed and
	  colors added. Displaying all four teams and their scores works properly. Sentry Gun health displayed to
	  the ones place (instead of 10's). Changed message "No blips" to "Scanning.." for Scout's scanner. Gren 1,
	  Gren2, and detpack amount will show up in status bar (Up2)
	- Medic/Engineer will see teammates' health/armor displayed to the ones digit instead of tens when using "id" (Up2)
	- Cease fire time (serverinfo ceasefire_time or cft) removed, unnecessary with /ready command
	  Note: This is different than doing ceasefire. cease fire time was a like prematch, except players
	  were not able to move or shoot before match started. (Up2)

Bugs Fixed:
	- Bugfix from tf2.9: setinfo sbs/sbr not being detected if you are a spectator. (Up2)
	- Bugfix from tf2.9: Fixed bug where TF didn't detect whether a match is a draw if all four teams were playing (Up2)
	- Large amounts of unused/unnecessary code removed/rewrote (Up2)
	- Rewrote match output code for alignment bugfixes (Up2)

--------------------------------------------
Version 2.92a					  03/15/2012
--------------------------------------------

Features Added:
	- Added a countdown menu which replaces the "10... 9..." message during the last 10 seconds of prematch.
	  One or two very small bugs remain which are due to strcat overflows, but these should rarely, if ever
	  be encountered. Currently, the countdown menu flickers if the player has their sbar on. I don't know
	  of a workaround at this moment. (Up2)
	- A new serverinfo field "qwtfver" has been added, similar to KTX (ktxver). May be useful for the future. (Up2)
	- Added strcat feature to the QWTF code, originally by FrikaC and supported by almost all modern engines.
	  Allows you to combine two strings. (Up2)

Changes:
	- The highest team score is now displayed in red in the Match Results table (Up2)
	- Misc small code changes, alignment changes, etc. (Up2)
	- Rpickup bug fixed. Rpickup will now only work in prematch. (Up2)

--------------------------------------------
Version 2.92					  01/01/2012
--------------------------------------------

Features Added:
	- "changeteam" is fully functional without any bugs (KillJoy)
	- New autoteam logic, fully random and supports all four teams (KillJoy/Up2)
	- Added "rpickup" functionality, similar to KTX. Known bug: does not timeout (it should when prematch ends!) (KillJoy/Up2)
	- New Match Results table which significantly reduces the console spam. (Up2)

Changes:
	- Removed kicks for changing color, skin, or team (KillJoy)
	- Changed the webpage address to https://github.com/quaketf (KillJoy)

--------------------------------------------
Version 2.91 - 09/23/2007		Internal Release
--------------------------------------------
Up2nOgOoD[ROCK] and KillJoy[FOLD] have taken over the project.

Features Added:
	- "changeteam" will now allow you to change teams without having to reconnect to the server (KillJoy)
		->todo: bugfix: player's corpse is left when he uses this feature

Changes:
	- TF will not kick you for changing colors (KillJoy)
	- Added brown "AUTOTEAM" with golden brackets when a player autoteams (KillJoy)
	- "Autozoom" on/off text is now brown to be more noticable (Up2)
	- Changed webpage address from planetquake.com/teamfortress (no longer exists) to www.sourceforge.net/projects/qwtf (Up2)

--------------------------------------------
Version 2.9				   Released 23/10/98
--------------------------------------------
Features Added:
	- Put in several QW server defaults due to changes in QW 2.3
		pausable = 0
		sv_friction = 6
		sv_waterfriction = 1
	- Spys can now silently feign without a death scream with the command "sfeign".
		The feign command in the spy's "special" menu will only do the default
		non-silent feign.
	- Persons in spectator mode can ID players they are looking at
		(if they are in range).  Also if the spectator has admin privilages, they
		can use the admin commands (see below).

Changes:
	- Tweaked concussion effect to take a player's ping into consideration.  Removed
		snapping the player's view.  Also a jumping player should get some concussion
		effects now.
	- HWGuy's are not affected by the concussion grenade's effects only when firing.
	- HWGuy is thrown slightly less by explosions.
	- HWGuy's "special" bind now switches between the Assault Cannon and the
		Super Shotgun.
	- Medic's "special" bind now switches between the Medikit and the Super
		Nailgun.
	- Admin commands have changed:
		- Instead of using the admin command "kick" to deal with a player, you
		now use the command "deal".  That command will do the same thing "kick"
		did, but this time after listing the name of each player in the game
		there is the option to use the commands "kick" (to simply kick them
		from the server), "ban" (to add their IP address to be banned from the
		server), or "next" (to list the next player in the game).
		When a player is banned with this method, their IP address will be removed
		from the server banlist if the server is ever restarted.
		- The command "listips" will show a list of all players in the game, along
		with their IP address in this format: NAME (IP ADDRESS)
	- Scout's scanner upgraded and commands changed.  The command has changed now
		to "autoscan" (you can still use the old commands if you still have them bound
		and they will execute the "autoscan" command). This command turns
		on/off the scout scanner. It will keep sending out "bursts" every 2 seconds while
		it is on. It is defaulted to only scan for enemies (this includes players,
		sentries and flags/goal items), but can be changed by using the commands "scane"
		(scan enemies) and "scanf" (scan friendlies). You CAN have both set.  The scanner
		also now has the ability to play a sound to the player if it detects an enemy.
		It is off by default but can be switched on/off with the "scansound" command.
		Also, the statusbar will now report what your scanner has detected (i.e., "Red
		Soldier", "Blue Sentry", etc.) and it's range from you in approximate meters.
	- EMP Grenades will not destroy own-team buildings if explosive damage to teammates
		is turned off on the server.
	- When medikit is selected, the medikit ammo will be displayed.
	- When a spy feigns he will now drop all goal items.
	- Feigning spies are no longer ID-able by enemies.
	- Spy's backstab ignores armor.
	- Spy now is allowed to have (and starts with) yellow armor.
	- New sentry code for finding targets.
	- Limited number of active napalm grenades and gas grenades per player to 2.
	- Incresed cell useage for cannon powerup from 4 to 7 to compensate for newly increased
		damage from bug fix.  Also the Heavy Weapon's guy can no longer move while
		spinning the Assault Cannon up, down, or while firing.
	- Thrown grenades now have a "throwing" sound rather than the grenade launcher sound.

Bugs Fixed:
	- A dead scout can no longer disarm a detpack.
	- Health boxes will now heal leg damage even if the player's health is
		>= his class's max health.
	- HWGuy can shoot while on the ground underwater now.
	- Demoman help menu fixed to show "[7] Pipebomb launcher".
	- Napalm Grenade fixed.  Explosions now follow the grenade instead of staying where
		the initial explosion started.  Also grenade will now properly extinguish if it
		enters water while exploding.
	- Fixed invisibility bug with spy (disguise & Ring of Shadows problems).
	- Removed the stuff regarding "imin1", "imin2", etc. (no longer used).
	- Fixed the old TF weblink.
	- Fixed the problem of armor gotten from a goal-item not absorbing damage.
	- Buildings and detpacks should get telefragged if a player respawns into them.
	- Fixed a few death message problems.
	- Multiple concussion grenade hits on a player should now only add on to the time
		the concussion effects last.
	- Fixed soldier clip reloading.
	- Fixed problem with some of the sounds that should play with the spy gas gren
		hallucinations.
	- Sentry will no longer fire at feigning spies.
	- Fixed bug with Assault Cannon damage.

--------------------------------------------
Version 2.81               Released 25/5/98
--------------------------------------------
Bugs Fixed:
	- Caltrops should now hurt the enemy when teamplay is set to not hurt
		teammates.

--------------------------------------------
Version 2.8                 Released 24/5/98
--------------------------------------------
Features Added:
	- EMP grenades now do damage to sentry guns.
	- New in-game messages for medic healing functions, spy uncovering and
		"aerial" pipebomb kills.  Made unique death messages for use
		with statistical programs in distinguishing classes.  Also team messages
		when engineer buildings are dismantled by other teammates.
	- Sentry guns now have a muzzleflash.
	- Server setting available to those who want to use the old effect grenades
		(i.e., old concussion, gas, and flash grenades): set "old_grens" to "on"
		(or abbreivated "og").  Default is "off".
	- If the player has the setinfo string "exec_map" (or "em") set, the file
		"mapdefault.cfg" will be executed if it exists when the player enters a server
		or the server map changes. If the player also has a specific .cfg file for the
		map on the server, that file will also be executed. (i.e., The player enters
		the game and 2fort5 is playing. The script "mapdefault.cfg" will be executed
		and then "2fort5.cfg" - if it exists).

Changes:
	- Impulse 100 removed.
	- Limited # of flares useable at one time to 9 / # of teams.
	- Scout must be looking directly at a detpack for him to begin disarming.
	- Made abbreviations for more setinfo commands:
		bd = birthday
		sbr = sbar_res
		sbs = sbar_size
		apw = adminpwd
		ec = exec_class
		ws = use_standard ("War Standard" flags)
	- Changed concussion grenade effects.  Instead of your "vision" only being
		impaired, you now stumble around.  The more you try to move, the more
		you stumble.  If you are against a wall and not moving at all, you can
		stabalize yourself.
	- Limited the amount of concussion grenades a medic/scout can carry to 3.
	- Put back the TF "War Standard" option for maps.
	- Scout's Flash Grenade replaced with the Caltrops Canister. Limited
		carry amount to 3 of these.  Prime time is 1 second.  When dropped,
		6 caltrops (spikes) will scatter on the ground at the scout's feet.
		Hitting a caltrop will cause damage and slow down the player until
		being healed (by health box or medic).
	- New spy gas grenade effects:  No more color changing for affected players.
		More explosion effects and random pain sounds (but no actual pain except when in
		the gas cloud itself) and other "illusions".  New effects disabled (like the
		other new grens) with the "old_grens" server setting.
	- Sniper sight is now a red dot which is now visible in both GL and non-GL QW 2.2x.

Bugs Fixed:
	- SpyInvis Only setting on non QW servers fixed.
	- Removed ability for multiple invincible sentry guns cheat.
	- Cannot use RandomPC to choose a server restricted class.
	- Due to stronger kicking, any cheats that were the result of
		getting "kicked" and staying in the game, such as the Medic/Sniper
		cheats, are now impossible.
	- Spy can no longer unfeign when anything at all is on top of him.
	- Detpacks can no longer hang in the air.
	- If sentry gun becomes separated (i.e., the gun "head" detaches from
		the base), it will blow up (i.e., "malfunction").
	- Fixed some typo's.
	- Sentry gun will not keep beeping when someone disconnects within its
		range.
	- Pyro flames really will go out under water now.
	- Fixed bug where medic would get multiple frags if infecting a player more
		than once and them ing by a means other than the infection.

        Normal. Each player's frags are equal to the Team's frags + the
        Team's score for map related goals.
    - PreMatch Mode
        Servers operating in Clan Battle Mode can set a PreMatch time period,
        in which Players can run around and shoot, but do nothing else.
        Once the PreMatch time is over, players are respawned.
    - Cease Fire Time
        Servers operating in Clan Battle Mode can set a Cease Fire time
        period at the beginning of the Match, in which Players can't move 
        or shoot.
    - Class Restrictions
        Servers can limit the number of players, in the same team, able to play 
        the same class. This can also be used to prevent any classes from being
        played at all.
    - Player Substitutions
        During Clan Battles, players who drop off and rejoin are automatically
        put in the same team they were in, and their Class, frags, etc are
        restored. Players can also sub in for another player in this way.
    - Locked Games
        Servers can prevent anyone joining games after the PreMatch time
        is over, except for substitutions for disconnected players.
    - Flag Emulation
        When turned on for the old maps which use keys for Flags, this
        feature will change the key to the new TF Flag.
    - Admin Capabilities
        Servers can have "admin" players who don't know the rcon password,
        but still have the ability to kick players and force cease-fires.
    - AutoKick
        Servers can enable an Autokicker which kicks players who kill
        a set number of their teammates over a set time period.
    - Anyone can tell the server they don't want to see the Classhelp
      by setting their infokey "classhelp" (or "ch") to "off".
    - Engineers can use the "detdispenser", "detsentry", "detentrance",
      and "detexit" commands to detonate their buildings without using 
      the menus.
    - Engineer buildings now explode when killed, with a blast radius
      dependant on the amount of explosive ammo they had in them.
    - Engineers can now build Teleporter Pads. He can only have one
      entrance and one exit in existence at the one time, but either 
      can be dismantled and built elsewhere without affecting the other.
      Teammates can use the teleporter by running onto it and stopping.
    - Engineers can rotate their sentries by hitting them with the spanner 
      to bring up the menu, and then each spanner hit after that rotates
      the sentry by 45 degrees.
    - Sentry Guns now attack monsters in Co-Op mode.
    - More realistic falling damage.
    - Players can use impulse 69 to change to the previously selected weapon.
    - QW Servers can specify an alternative directory to "qwmcycle" 
      using the "cycledir" serverinfo key, and the server will use the 
      mapX.cfg files in that directory instead.
    - QW Servers can now store TF in any directory, but the "sv_gamedir"
      key must still be "fortress". 
    - Players can now change classes using the "changeclass" command,
      if the server allows it. This will bring up the normal class menu.
    - Players can set the "take_sshot" infokey to "on", which will make
      TF automatically take a screenshot of the end game scores for you.
    - Players can set the "exec_class" infokey to "on", which will make
      TF automatically exec the "class".cfg file whenever you change
      classes. (e.g. it'll exec scout.cfg if you're a scout)
    - Thanks to the QW Team's addition of player maxspeeds, and the increase
      of the QW speed limit, all classes now move at their correct speeds,
      and speed cheating is impossible, even wall-strafing.
    - 4 More Teamplay bits which work as follows:
    	Bit 128:   Team-members only lose 1/2 armor from direct fire.
    	Bit 256:   Team-members lose no armor from direct fire.

    - Demoman speed dropped by 20.

    - Scouts/Spies get a frag for unmasking enemy spies.
    - Scout's bounding box restored to the normal player size.

    - Pyro napalm grenades in the net version are now actually dangerous.

Map Code Enhancements:                                   
    - Map Debug cleaned up a lot.
    - Showloc debug dumps the current angle too.
    - A new bit (32) was added to "goal_result" for Goals/etc which forces
      anyone affected by the goal to simply respawn. The player doesn't
      die... just respawns.
    - A new bit (2048) was added to "goal_activation" for Goals and GoalItems.
        2048: If this bit is set, the Goal/Item drops to the ground when it
              first spawns.
    - Another new bit (4096) was added to "goal_result" for GoalItems.
        4096: If this bit is set, any player carrying this item can drop
              it using the "dropitems" command.
    - Yet another bit (8192) was added to "goal_activation" for GoalItems.
        8192: If this bit is set, the GoalItem is Solid while not
              being carried by a player. This means it blocks bullets,
              grenades.
              N.B. It will also block any players that don't pass it's
                   criteria. Players that do pass the criteria will
                   simply pick it up.
    - The size of a Goal or GoalItem can now be set using the "goal_min"
      and "goal_max" variables to set the min and max bounding box.
      If not set, they default to:
		"goal_min"       "-16 -16 -24"
		"goal_max"       "16 16 32"
    - More Abbreviations, as follows:
    	Floats
            "h_i_g"	    for     "has_item_from_group"
            "r_i_g" 	for     "remove_item_group"

            "a_s"		for     "ammo_shells"
            "a_n"		for     "ammo_nails"
            "a_r"		for     "ammo_rockets"
            "a_c"		for     "ammo_cells"

            "rv_s_h"	for     "remove_spawngroup"
            "rs_s_h"	for     "restore_spawngroup"
            "rv_gr"	    for     "remove_group_no"
            "rs_gr"	    for     "restore_group_no"
            "rv_g"	    for     "remove_goal_no"
            "rs_g"	    for     "restore_goal_no"
	- The "ex_skill_min" and "ex_skill_max" variables can now
      use "-1" to mean 0. This is needed because specifying either
      as 0 is the same as not specifying it at all.
      E.g. An entity with:
                "ex_skill_min" "-1"
                "ex_skill_max" "-1"
           Would only exist at skill 0.
            An entity with:
                "ex_skill_min" "-1"
                "ex_skill_max" "2"
           Would only exist at skill 0, 1, or 2.

	  	64 : If this bit is set, then instead of just applying this Goal's

			 "goal_effects" variable, this Goal checks it's criteria for
			 each player in the group and then applies it's results 
			 invididually to any of them that pass.

--------------------------------------
Version 2.5 Beta I  - Released  3/6/97
--------------------------------------

				is not in the same environment as the Goal, don't affect him.
				Environments are air, water, slime, lava.
				e.g. If a Goal is above some water, and does a radius effect
				     with "t_length", and a player in the water is within the

Features Added:
	- Demomen can select pipebomb launcher with impulse 7, and 6
	  always selects normal grenades.

Changes:
	- Medic's now heal teammates fully in one hit with the medikit, and
	  it doesn't use any medikit ammo.
	- If a Medic hits a teammate with the medikit, and the teammate is already
	  fully healed, then the Medic will add 5 megahealth to the teammate,

Map Code Enhancements:
	- There are now abbreviations for many of the mapcode entity's strings.
	  This should help for those of you having trouble with Quake's limit on
	  a map's entity details.

	- Various centerprinted messages have been fixed.

Map Code Changes:
	- "delay" variable used for delaying goal results has been changed
	  to "delay_time", to allow for better backwards compatability.

Map Code breakages (Old maps won't work if you used these)
	- Way back in version 1.3 the "goal_effects" variable was introduced,
	  to allow goals to affect more than one player. In version 1.21 you
	  didn't have to specify a "goal_effects" variable... instead, any
	  goal simply affected it's AP. To allow for backwards compatability,
	  in all versions since 1.3, any Goal that did not specify a "goal_effects"
	  field automatically had it's "goal_effects" set to 1, which is affect
	  AP only. This has become a problem now, since it prevents map-makers
	  from having goals that have a "goal_effects" of 0.
	  From this version onwards, the "goal_effects" variable will be left 
	  as it is in the .map file. So, if you have a map which contains any
	  Goals/Items that do _not_ have a "goal_effects" variable specified,
	  add it in and set it to 1.

--------------------------------------

	  never use teamfrags. This is now the default.

-------------------------------------
Version 2.1  - Released 22/1/97
-------------------------------------
Features Added:
	- "maphelp" alias which gives you a short description of the
	  map you're playing, if it's a TF map and a description has 
	  been supplied by the map creator.
	- "flaginfo" alias which gives you a display of the status
	  of the flags on any map which the map creator provides a 
	  flag info section in the Detection entity.
	  Works for all CTF maps as well.
	- Civilian Class. Sorry, you can't play this one by choice. It is
	  only used on special maps.
	- QuakeWorld grappling hook.

Bugs Fixed:
	- Quake Plats and Doors AP checking fixed
	- Quake Trigger reverse-AP-criteria fixed
	- Spawncode fixed and enhanced
	- Level Cycling removed, rewritten, and hopefully fixed!
	  N.B. You can't use nextlevel anymore to pick your next level.
	       Instead, the server admin chooses the levels he/she wants
		   the patch to cycle through.

Changes:
	- Speed Cheat Checking has been updated, so those cheating soldiers
	  out there won't be moving so fast.
	- Finally updated this doc!

Map Code Enhancements:
    - Goals can specify a team they belong to
	- Goals can specify a starting state
	- Activation Criteria can check other Goal's states
	- Can Centerprint to members on/not-on AP's team
	- Detection entity can specify a custom Team Menu message
	- Detection entity can specify a Map Help message
	- Entities can specify whether they exist for different "skill" settings
	- TeamSpawn points can remove themselves after being spawned on
	- GoalItems can glow when not being carried
	- Detection entity can restrict available classes for each team
	- All Goals can specify an 'else' goal, which is activated if this isn't
	- Detection entity can now specify a maximum number of players in each team
	- All Goals can display the status of upto 2 GoalItems when activated
	- GoalItems can centerprint messages to players when they return
	- Detection entity can restrict teams to the Civilian class for fancy maps
	- Can Centerprint to owners of a Goal/Item when it's activated
	- Any Goal/Item can force an item to return
	- Any Goal check whether any GoalItem is at its origin in it's Criteria
	- Goals that give out GoalItems can specify whether they want to the Item
	  itself to apply results.
	- Detection entity can specify that the Grappling Hook cannot be used
	- Any Goal can remove/restore Team Spawnpoints
	- GoalItems can specify console item's they'd like to light up when carried

Map Code Changes:
	- "Personal Message" is now centerprinted to AP
	- "Broadcast Message" is now centerprinted to everyone else
	- Goals activated by others now check their Criteria before activating
	- GoalItems don't restore a goal when they return, now they activate it

Map Code breakages (Old maps won't work if you used these)
	- Detection entity can now make Pyro class illegal. 
	  It replaces the Random PC prevention. 
	  This will only cause a problem if you have a map which
	  prevented players from playing Random PC.
	- GoalItems don't restore a goal when they return, now they activate it.
	  If you had any GoalItems using the "impulse" variable to restore a Goal
	  when the GoalItem returns, you'll need to redo the Goalwork.
	  My suggestion: Say a GoalItem was restoring Goal A when it returned.
					 Make a Goal B. Make the GoalItem activate Goal B when
					 it returns. Make Goal B restore Goal A. 
	  If you're wondering why I did this, it's because an activating goal
	  can restore a goal, and do much more. This way, you're not limited in
	  what you want to do when a GoalItem is returned.

-------------------------------------
Version 2.0  - Beta Released 22/12/96
-------------------------------------
	QUAKEWORLD

--------------------------------
Version 1.37 - Beta Released
--------------------------------
So many changes, so here are just a few of them:
	- Pipebombs completely cleaned up. Now there's a 
	  limit defined in options.qc, default 10, and
	  this is divided out between teams.
	  e.g. in 2 team games, both teams can have upto 5.
	- "reload" fixed.
	- "dropammo" fixed.
	- Concussion gren healing fixed.
	- Teamplay options are much better.
	- Temp1 variable now hold Toggleflags, so they
	  persist over maps.
	- maxammo for all ammo increased for each
	  class, so that scouts can carry rockets,
	  but still not use them. This way they can
	  carry them to team members.
	- BioWeapon and Medikit can be merged into
	  one weapon if MEDIKIT_IS_BIOWEAPON is defined.
	  It heals if you hit a teammember and infects
	  if you hit an enemy. This is default for net servers.
	- Dropammo menu appears faster
	- Spawn blood when curing concussion
	- Prevented infections attacking your own team,
	  if teamplay options prevent it doing damage
	- telefragged players respawn a couple of seconds
	  later, so we don't get that telefrag crap.
	- autoteam kicks in after 30 seconds into a map.
	  So teams can be restructured when people enter
	  a new map, and then after 30 seconds, people will
	  be assigned automatically.
	- Firing removes help now, and prints the "8 to see..."
	- People can now ask for bindings to be done for them,
	  with a selection of keys for mouse and key players.
	- Player's push each other, and flag carrying players
	  have a bigger weight.

--------------------------------
Version 1.33 - Released 11/11/96
--------------------------------
Bugs Removed:
	- Nextlevel command not working.

--------------------------------
Version 1.32 - Released 10/11/96
--------------------------------
Features added:
	- Nextlevel command.
		Players can use the "Nextlevel" command to cycle through the
		v1.3 FortressMaps and choose which one will be played when the
		current one ends.
	- Deathmatch 3 setting.
		When in deathmatch 3, players can choose the class they will
		respawn as.

Changes:
	- Removed all pre-impulses.
	  	We used these in LAN games and they're fine. But on the net,
	  	the lag can cause problems with them. So they're gone. We 
	  	have left in the pre-impulses for Detpacks and Scanners so
	  	players can still define their own time settings/energy levels.
	- Detpack setting changed.
	  	Instead of stopping you for 4 seconds when you set a detpack,
	  	now you have to hold down the Detpack-Set key for 4 seconds
	  	without moving, and you can stop and run at any time.
	 	The old method is still there if you want to use it instead.
	- Sniper Rifle changed.
		It takes a little longer to build up the damage now, so snap-shots
		won't kill so much. Aiming still builds up the damage.
		Also, the Sniper must stop moving before he can start to aim.
	- Team Color Checking
		Now it doesn't penalise the player in any way for changing colors,
		it just sets them back. Players with lag on servers would get 
		penalised before they're colors had been set when they joined a 
		team. :)

Bugs Removed:
	- Announcing of class choices when deathmatching.
	- Sniper aiming not incrementing damage.
	- Teamfrags not keeping correct count.
	- Team 4 wasn't working.
